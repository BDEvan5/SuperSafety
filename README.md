# SuperSafety

Note: The simulator used (stored in the f110_gym folder) is not my own work but has been directly copied from https://github.com/f1tenth/f1tenth_gym

The rest of the repo contains the code for the paper entitled, "Learning without Crashing: Safe Reinforcement Learning for
Autonomous Racing using a Supervisor based on Viability Theory".
