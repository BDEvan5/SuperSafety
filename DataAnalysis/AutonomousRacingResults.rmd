# Kernel Safety Tests

Firstly, we run random tests to ensure that the kernels are safe and that they do work.

```{r, kernel_safety}
kernel_gen = data %>%
  filter(eval_name=="KernelGen")%>%
  select(map_name, SSS_avg_interventions, SSS_avg_times, SSS_std_dev, SSS_success_rate)
  
kable(kernel_gen)
